Project goals: I wanted to make a game that I personally would play, and knew that I could execute well.
Instructions: Enter a letter you think might be in the word, given the number of spaces provided.
I used classes and functions to make this. There are no real graphics, so I just used keyboard inputs that best made the image of the classic hangman.
Process: I didn't do any outside learning for this, I've just used what I've learned in class and a bit of utilization of the help function.
I got stuck at times with the counting tries, and figuring out how to print lines and input for the gameplay.
I'd like to improve my usage of numbers because I am a mathematics major and will need to use them a lot. I'd like to have a better grasp of that in coding.
If I remade this in the future, I'd try to use pygame and simpleGE to get real graphics.
I strayed a bit by not making a separate file for the graphics of the hangman.
I stayed on track with everything else.
